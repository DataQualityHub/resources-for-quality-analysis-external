# Quality Questions and Red Flags

This document is published and maintained by the Data Quality Hub and the Analysis Standards and Pipelines Hub, based at ONS. 

The information below aims to provide support and guidance to colleagues working on statistical outputs and analysis across government. 

The [Quality Questions](#quality-questions) table include a set of questions that the analyst can use to interrogate their work with their team and will support them in assuring the quality of their work. The document explains why the question is important, and what help, guidance, and support is available. You can also look for specific information, we suggest you read down the first column and when you find a question that is relevant to you, you can read across that row of the table for more information. 

The [Quality Red Flags](#quality-red-flags) table include a set of statements that can help the analyst and their team to identify potential risks to quality that might benefit from further investigation. These statements are not meant to be considered as a value judgment, but more as a suggestion that best practice and support could be beneficial. 

We will be developing this page and welcome your feedback on the content and the structure.

## Quality Questions


| Quality Question  | Why do I need to know the answer to this? | What help is available here? |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **What is the need for this analysis or statistical release?**  |  Understanding why the analysis/statistical release is needed and what it will be used for is critical for understanding whether what you have done is fit for purpose. If you are responsible for part of an analytical/statistical process, understanding the end use will help you to make sure that your part does what is needed to meet user needs. | > [Guidance: The AQUA Book](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/416478/aqua_book_final_web.pdf) <br> > [Guidance: Analysis Functional Standard](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-analysis-functional-standard--2) <br> > Get in touch with your User Research team or equivalent in your department
| **Who uses your analysis or statistical release?** | Understanding who uses your analysis/statistical release will help you to make sure that it meets their needs. It also helps you to tailor your outputs to make sure all your users are fully supported in using the outputs effectively. | > [Guidance: User engagement top tips](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/user-engagement-top-tips/) <br> > Get in touch with your team leader and User Researchers or equivalent in your department to support in understanding who your users are.
| **What analytical question you are addressing?** | Having a clear understanding of the problem your team is trying to solve ensures that the analysis you design is fit for purpose. If you do not know how your work is contributing to answering an analytical need, you may be unaware of important requirements or limitations for your part of the work. | > [Guidance: The AQUA Book](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/416478/aqua_book_final_web.pdf) <br> > [Guidance: Analysis Functional Standard](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-analysis-functional-standard--2) <br> 
| **What is the quality of the data that you use?** | Understanding the quality of your data inputs is critical. It enables you to assess limitations and uncertainty in the inputs and how they feed through to your outputs. If you don't understand this, you will be unable to assess the quality of your process or your outputs. Understanding the quality of the data will allow you to assess whether the data can be used to address your analytical questions and the underlying user needs. | > [The Government Data Quality Framework](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-government-data-quality-framework/the-government-data-quality-framework) <br> >  [Introduction to data quality](https://bpi-courses.github.io/Introduction_to_Data_Quality/) <br> > [Introduction to data quality assessments](https://bpi-courses.github.io/Introduction_to_data_quality_assessments/) <br> > [Tips for urgent quality assurance of data](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/tips-for-urgent-quality-assurance-of-data/) <br> > [Quality Assurance of Administrative Data (QAAD) toolkit](https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/guidance/administrative-data-and-official-statistics/) <br> > [Quality of Admin Data in Statistics (Draft guidance)](https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/admin-data-quality-stats/index.html) <br> > [Data Quality Action Plans](https://bpi-courses.github.io/Data-Quality-Action-Plans/) <br> > [Data Quality Dimensions](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/meet-the-data-quality-dimensions) <br> > [Quality Assurance: Four Areas of Practice](https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/guidance/administrative-data-and-official-statistics/quality-assurance-four-key-areas-of-practice/) 
| **How did you choose the methods for the analysis or statistical release?** | You should be able to explain why you chose the method (or set of methods) that you are using to produce your analysis or statistical release. A clear rationale for your method gives you and your users confidence that your choice is based on sound reasoning and evidence. | > [Guidance: The AQUA Book](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/416478/aqua_book_final_web.pdf) <br> > [Guidance: Analysis Functional Standard](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-analysis-functional-standard--2) 
| **How do you know the method you are using is appropriate?** | You should be able to explain why the method(s) you use are suitable for this analysis/statistical release and be able to support your choice with evidence. This might include reference to academic peer review or other projects that are similar. If you can't explain why you chose the methods you use and why they are right for your analysis and the data you are using, you cannot be sure that your approach is sound. | > [Guidance: The AQUA Book](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/416478/aqua_book_final_web.pdf) 
| **Can you summarise and explain the end-to-end process of your analysis or statistical release for somebody who asks about it?** | Having an overview of your analysis/statistical release (especially if you only work on part of it) ensures that you and your team understand how your work feeds into the wider product. It can help you to identify potential quality risks or issues, both upstream and downstream of your own work as well as how your activity supports and underpins downstream processing. | > [Guidance: The AQUA Book](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/416478/aqua_book_final_web.pdf) <br> > [Generic Statistical Business Process Model (GSBPM)](https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Generic-Statistical-Business-Process-Model.pdf) 
| **How do you know that your analysis or statistical process is working correctly?** | You need to be sure that your analysis produces the outputs that you think it should and that the processes you run work as expected. If you cannot demonstrate that scripts and processes you have set up are functioning correctly, you cannot confirm the quality of the results. | > [Guidance: Verification and validation for the AQUA Book](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/verification-and-validation-for-the-aqua-book) 
| **Would another analyst be able to pick up from where you left off and reproduce or continue the work (without talking to you first)?** | Your analysis must be well documented so that somebody new can understand it and pick it up. Poor documentation means that other people will not understand why the process is configured as it is, how the process works or how to run the process safely - potentially leading to errors. | > [Guidance: The AQUA Book](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/416478/aqua_book_final_web.pdf) <br> > [Guidance QA of Code for Analysis and Research](https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/qa-of-code-guidance/intro.html) 
| **If you find a mistake in your analysis, do you have a clear and efficient process for addressing the issue and preventing it from happening again?** | Analysis with lots of manual steps or that uses several tools is usually hard to assure. When problems happen, finding out how and why can be really difficult, and this does not apply only to manual processing. If your process is in this category, you are probably carrying extra quality risks. | > [Guidance: Analysis Functional Standard](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-analysis-functional-standard--2) <br> > [Guidance QA of Code for Analysis and Research](https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/qa-of-code-guidance/intro.html) <br> > [Guidance: The AQUA Book](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/416478/aqua_book_final_web.pdf) 
| **Do you consistently use peer review to check scripts and code, documentation, implementation of methods, processes and outputs?** | Peer review is a standard part of analysis best practice. It is helpful because it helps to identify where steps are unclear, documents are hard to understand or there might be problems with calculations or implementation of methods. Routine peer review helps to improve the quality of processes and to reduce risk by identifying potential problems. | > [Guidance: Quality assurance of code for analysis and research](https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/qa-of-code-guidance/intro.html) <br> > [Guidance: Quality statistics in government](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/quality-statistics-in-government/#quality-assurance) 
| **What are the limitations of your analysis or statistical release?** | You should be able to explain any issues or limitations with your analysis/statistical release, and how they impact on potential use. A formal log of issues and limitations is a good way to make sure everybody in the team understands potential problems. | > [Guidance: The AQUA Book](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/416478/aqua_book_final_web.pdf)  
| **Could you give a clear account of what can and cannot be inferred from your analysis or statistical release?** | Ultimately our analysis/statistical releases should inform public commentary and decisions taken. A clear statement of the extent to which the analysis does and does not support these will help reduce the chance of errors in these actions. | > [Guidance: Communicating quality, uncertainty and change](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/communicating-quality-uncertainty-and-change/) <br> > [e-learning: Communicating quality, uncertainty, and change](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/training/communicating-quality-uncertainty-and-change/) <br> > [Guidance: The AQUA Book](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/416478/aqua_book_final_web.pdf) 
| **Have you assessed the impact of the limitations and set out how they will affect the quality and use of the outputs?** | Where you have identified limitations (for example, data quality issues) you should be able to explain how they impact on the quality of the analysis. If you cannot, you do not know how good the output is. | > [e-learning: Communicating quality, uncertainty, and change](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/training/communicating-quality-uncertainty-and-change/) <br> > [Guidance: The AQUA Book](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/416478/aqua_book_final_web.pdf) 
| **How do you measure and report uncertainty in your analysis or statistical release?** | No analysis is perfect and no data are completely correct. You should be able to explain how you have assessed and measured the uncertainty that affects your analysis. | > [Guidance: Communicating quality, uncertainty and change](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/communicating-quality-uncertainty-and-change/) <br> > [e-learning: Communicating quality, uncertainty, and change](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/training/communicating-quality-uncertainty-and-change/) <br> > [Guidance: The AQUA Book](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/416478/aqua_book_final_web.pdf)
| **What is the assessment of the quality of your analytical outputs?** | Understanding and reporting on the quality of your analytical outputs is critical to ensure fitness for purpose, as well as trust and reliability. This ensures that analysis can appropriately inform decision-making. Your quality assessments are also key information to be shared with your users as well as being a requirement of the Code of Practice for Statistics. | > [Guidance: Quality statistics in government](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/quality-statistics-in-government/) <br> > [Tips for urgent quality assurance of ad-hoc analysis](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/top-tips-for-quality-assuring-urgent-pieces-of-ad-hoc-statistical-analysis/) <br> > [Guidelines for measuring statistical quality](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/dnss/docs-nqaf/UK-Guidelines_Subject.pdf) <br> > [Mandatory training on Quality Statistics in government](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/training/quality-statistics-in-government/) <br> > [Mandatory introductory training on Code of Practice](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/training/introducing-the-code-of-practice-for-statistics/)


## Quality Red Flags


| Quality Red Flags | Why do I need to know the answer to this? | What help is available here? |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **I don’t know who the GSS Quality Champion(s) for my department is**  |  Your local GSS Quality Champion can advise on best practice for assuring your analysis, and will have a wider perspective on the work of your department. Make use of their knowledge and experience. New members are always welcome! | > The [Data Quality Hub](mailto:DQHub@ons.gov.uk) can advise on who the GSS Quality Champions are in your area
| **I am not sure what the best-practice guidance is for my work** | If you don't know the recommended way to do things, you are unlikely to follow best practice by chance. Having a good understanding of best practice will help you to improve quality and reduce risk. | > [The Analysis Function guidance hub has helpful guidance about analytical best practice](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/)  
| **I don't know who to contact about the methods I use** | Things change - society and the economy, households and businesses evolve and so do our data. We need to adapt methods to address these changes and sustain the quality of our outputs. Lack of contact with methodologists and academics may indicate a deficit in the quality of methods used | > Methodology and the Analysis Standards and Pipelines Hub based at ONS (see below for contact details) 
| **I don’t know how to understand the quality of my data and its implications on my results** | If you don't know how to assess the quality of the data used in your analysis you will be unable to measure the quality of the outputs or to decide if they are fit for purpose | > [The Government Data Quality Framework](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-government-data-quality-framework/the-government-data-quality-framework) <br> >  [Introduction to data quality](https://bpi-courses.github.io/Introduction_to_Data_Quality/) <br> >  [Introduction to data quality assessments](https://bpi-courses.github.io/Introduction_to_data_quality_assessments/) <br> > [Tips for urgent quality assurance of data](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/tips-for-urgent-quality-assurance-of-data/) <br> > [Quality Assurance of Administrative Data (QAAD) toolkit](https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/guidance/administrative-data-and-official-statistics/) <br> > [Quality of Admin Data in Statistics (Draft guidance)](https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/admin-data-quality-stats/index.html) <br> > [Data Quality Action Plans](https://bpi-courses.github.io/Data-Quality-Action-Plans/) <br> > [Data Quality Dimensions](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/meet-the-data-quality-dimensions) <br> > [Quality Assurance: Four Areas of Practice](https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/guidance/administrative-data-and-official-statistics/quality-assurance-four-key-areas-of-practice/) <br> > The [Data Quality Hub](mailto:DQHub@ons.gov.uk) can advise and provide support on assessing data quality and understanding implications for results and analysis 
| **I don’t know how my outputs will be used** | If you don't know what your outputs will be used for you cannot be sure that they will meet user needs. A good understanding of likely use cases is an essential part of making sure your analysis is fit for purpose. | > [Guidance: User engagement top tips](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/user-engagement-top-tips/) <br> > Get in touch with your team leader and relevant User Researchers or equivalent in your department to support in understanding how your outputs will be used 
| **I can’t describe the assumptions of my analysis or statistical release, when they were made and who made them and signed them off** | All analysis involves assumptions. Understanding what those are (and being clear how and why you made them) is critical for understanding why the analysis works the way it does. Keeping a log of the assumptions you make, when you made them and who agreed them is a really helpful way to keep track of this | > The Analysis and Standards and Pipelines Hub based at ONS (see below for contact details) can advise you on how to track and manage your assumptions.
| **My colleagues never challenge me about the results I produce** | People working with your results will have expectations about what the results will be and observed departures from these expectations are an important part of the QA process. An independent layer of QA, possibly including a curiosity-type session will help with this assurance. This can be on the overall results or a component, e.g for a sector or for the latest set of weights | > The Data Quality Hub and the Analysis Standards and Pipelines Hub based at ONS (see below for contact details) can support you in developing further QA and/or start curiosity sessions 
| **I can’t describe how important decisions were made about my analysis or statistical release, when they were made or who made them and signed them off** | All analysis involves decisions. Understanding what those are (and being clear how and why you made them) is critical for understanding why the analysis works the way it does. Keeping a log of the decisions you make, when you made them and who agreed them is a really helpful way to keep track of this | >  The Analysis Standards and Pipelines Hub based at ONS (see below for contact details) can advise you on how to track and manage your decisions
| **I don’t fully understand the end-to-end process of the analysis or statistical release** | It is important that you understand how your work feeds into the bigger picture, especially if you only work on a small part of an analysis workflow. If you are not aware of issues with the inputs to your work, or how your work feeds into other work later in the process you may miss important quality issues or fail to include important quality checks that don't impact you directly but have a big effect later on in the process | > Your team leader or Deputy Director can support in understanding the end-to-end process of the analysis
| **I can’t explain how the work I do impacts on downstream processes** | Most analysis feeds into other work. Your outputs might be re-used by analysts in a policy department, for example, or to add value to another ONS output. While it is not possible to keep track of every possible use of your data, you should have a good idea of the main uses that your analysis supports so you can be sure it meets user needs | > [Guidance: User engagement top tips](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/user-engagement-top-tips/) <br> > [Generic Statistical Business Process Model (GSBPM)](https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Generic-Statistical-Business-Process-Model.pdf) <br> > Your team leader or Deputy Director can support in understanding the impact of your work and other processes dependent on it
| **It is difficult to assess the errors and uncertainty in the analysis or statistical release** | You should be able to measure and explain how uncertainty affects your analysis. What is the margin of error around your outputs, for example? If it is difficult to measure uncertainty you should think about what this means for use of the outputs and whether there is anything you can do to improve your assessment of uncertainty. No analysis is 100 percent certain! | > [Guidance: Communicating quality, uncertainty and change](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/communicating-quality-uncertainty-and-change/) 
| **Errors and problems are hard to find and fix when they happen** | Complex manual processes are usually hard to quality assure. If you find that it is hard to find where issues occur, and takes a lot of time to fix them, your process is carrying quality risks and could also be inefficient | > [Guidance: Quality assurance of code for analysis and research](https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/qa-of-code-guidance/intro.html)
| **It is hard for a new starter to understand the process and pick it up** | Analysis that is not well documented is hard to understand and hard to reproduce. If it is difficult for members of the team to understand how your analysis works, what steps it involves and any issues, limitations and assumptions then it will be hard for them to run the process. They may also miss potential risks or errors | > The Data Quality Hub and the Analysis Standards and Pipelines Hub based at ONS (see below for contact details) can advise on documenting and ensuring reproducibility.
| **It is difficult to track who made changes to code or datasets and when and why those changes were made** | Good version control ensures that you have a full understanding of when, why and how changes were made to your analysis process. If it is hard to track changes, this makes it hard to retrace steps if there is a problem and means you do not fully understand the process | > [Guidance: Quality assurance of code for analysis and research](https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/qa-of-code-guidance/intro.html)
| **All or part of the analysis is reliant on a single person** | Single points of failure carry significant business risk. If there is only one person who understands how to carry out all or part of the analysis then the process is extremely vulnerable | > The GSS Quality Champion in your area can advise on how to flag this risk in your team or department
| **Understanding of how and why the process works as it does is reliant on the knowledge or skills of a single person** | Single points of failure carry significant business risk. If there is only one person who understands why the analysis works the way it does then the process is extremely vulnerable | > The GSS Quality Champion in your area can advise on how to flag this risk in your team or department
| **The analysis I do contains lots of manual steps, like copying and pasting data from one file to another or moving data between software packages with separate steps in each** | Manual processes are often inefficient and are prone to user error - a manual process is inherently more risky than a well-designed automated one. Where these exist, you should recognise the need for extra quality assurance to verify that the results are as intended | > [Guidance: Quality assurance of code for analysis and research](https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/qa-of-code-guidance/intro.html)
| **I use one or more of the following systems to produce my analysis: CSDB, SAS, SPSS, Stata, Ingres BAW, Excel, or other legacy systems, and there is no plan to move away from legacy tools** | Most legacy systems do not support reproducible analysis best practices, and proprietary tools (such as Excel or Stata) are closed source, meaning we cannot fully understand how they work. Workflows that use legacy and/or proprietary tools carry quality risks | > [Guidance: Quality assurance of code for analysis and research](https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/qa-of-code-guidance/intro.html) |
